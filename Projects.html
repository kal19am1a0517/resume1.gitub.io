    <h2>An Examination System Automation Using Natural Language Processing</h2>
    <p>In the proposed model we are talking the online examination to the new level by enabling the
        examinee to write the descriptive answers which will get evaluated on their own.The evaluated
        answers will be stored in the database and a particular student profile will be maintained for 
        better evaluation of the student.Talking about the technology used in order
        to build such a model,NLP or Natural Language Processing has a great role to play.
        NLTK is the tool used in NLP.
